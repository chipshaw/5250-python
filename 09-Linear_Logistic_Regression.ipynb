    "# Linear and logistic regression modeling, a case study with the NHANES data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces two statistical modeling techniques: linear\n",
    "regression and logistic regression.  The focus here will be on fitting\n",
    "these two types of models to data, using Python statistical modeling\n",
    "libraries in the Jupyter notebook environment.  As with several previous\n",
    "case studies in this course, here we will be analyzing the\n",
    "[NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) data, allowing us\n",
    "to illustrate the use of these two regression methods for addressing\n",
    "meaningful questions with actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the NHANES data were collected as a designed survey, and in\n",
    "general should be analyzed as such.  This means that survey design\n",
    "information such as weights, strata, and clusters should be accounted\n",
    "for in any analysis using NHANES.  But to introduce how linear and\n",
    "logistic regression are used with independent data samples, or with convenience\n",
    "samples, we will not incorporate the survey structure of the NHANES sample\n",
    "into the analyses conducted here.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with our previous work, we will be using the\n",
    "[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) library for data management, the\n",
    "[Numpy](http://www.numpy.org) library for numerical calculations, and\n",
    "the [Statsmodels](http://www.statsmodels.org) library for statistical\n",
    "modeling.\n",

    "We begin by importing the libraries that we will be using."

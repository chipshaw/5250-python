If you are unfamiliar with CamelCase, it is a convention where each letter that starts a word is capitalized, with no underscores in the name.

This means you can base a new class on an existing class; the new class *inherits* all of the attributes and behavior of the class it is based on. A new class can override any undesirable attributes or behavior of the class it inherits from, and it can add any new attributes or behavior that are appropriate.
